# Profiles Directory

This directory stores Camoufox profile JSON files.

Each profile is stored as a separate JSON file with the profile ID as the filename.

Profile files are created and managed by:
- The Camoufox Python library (`camoufox.profile` module)
- The Camoufox UI (Next.js application)

See `docs/PROFILES.md` for more information on the profile system.
